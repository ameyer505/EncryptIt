This program encrypts and decrypts files using AES symmetric key crypto.

(While encrypting):

This program writes the encrypted file back to the directory that the unencrypted
is currenting in, using this format:

<filename>-encrypted.txt

(While Decrypting):

This program writes the decrypted file back to the direcotry that the encrypted file
is currenting in, using the format:

<filename>-decrypted.txt

Use this program at YOUR own risk, there are no safeguards for if you forget the password to a file.
